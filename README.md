# Data Visualization Project - NOVA IMS

## 📊 Overview
This repository contains the **Data Visualization Project** for the **Master’s in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (2024/2025)** at **NOVA IMS**. The project aims to explore and present a **non-obvious** perspective on a selected dataset through effective visual storytelling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the process of **data visualization** and how to combine visual elements to communicate insights.
- Organize, prepare, and present **meaningful** and **effective** visualizations.
- Apply principles of **visual perception** and **communication**.

## 🏗️ Project Phases
### 🔹 Phase 1: Visualization Development
1. **Selection of Theme & Dataset**  
   - The dataset should be reliable and allow for unique insights.
2. **Choice of Media**  
   - Decide on the platform (e.g., website, interactive dashboard, static images).
3. **Visual Organization**  
   - Apply **graphical principles** to structure the visualization.
4. **Selection of Visual Elements**  
   - Define the use of **shapes, colors, typography, and images**.
5. **Composition & Refinement**  
   - Apply **Gestalt theory** and **visual perception** concepts to improve communication.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Final Report
The project is accompanied by a detailed **report**, including:
- **Dataset & Storytelling Perspective**  
- **Visual Design Decisions** (media choice, layout, colors, typography)
- **Meaning & Interpretation**  
- **Process Documentation** (iterations, sketches, and final versions)

## 🚀 Technologies Used
The project can be developed using any appropriate technology, including:
- **Python** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Tableau / Power BI**
- **D3.js**
- **R (ggplot2, Shiny)**
- **Adobe Illustrator / Figma**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for interactive web-based visualizations)

## 📅 Timeline
- **March 11-14**: Choose dataset & topic
- **March 18-21**: Define media format
- **March 25-28**: Organize visual elements
- **April 1-4**: Final presentation & report submission

## 📂 Deliverables
- **Prototype**: The developed visualization showcasing the selected insights.  
- **Final Report**: A **PDF** document justifying all design choices.
